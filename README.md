# My dotfiles on Arch Linux

Here my dotfiles for every new fresh install of Arch Linux (tipically a new Virtual Machine).

I `git clone` the repository and set environmental variable _$DOTFILES_ to the destination directory where the script `install.sh` is located (i.e. `~/dotfiles` directory) and then simply run the script.

All the files and directorues will replace once in my system with my configurations.

Related project is _arch_installer_ for automate installazione of a new fresh arch linux virtual machine through virt-manager.
